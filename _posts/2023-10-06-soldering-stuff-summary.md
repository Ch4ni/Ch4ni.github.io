A question that I've either been asked personally, or seen asked in public forums several times now is: what should I get to begin soldering?

The succinct, accurate answer is: it really depends on what you want to do!

That answer, however, isn't really helpful for anyone, so I thought it might be nice to provide a list of the equipment I have available, why I chose it, and what might work instead. What works for me may not work for someone else, but at least this list and rationale should give anyone else a starting point to curating their own home lab, or whatever type of kit they want!

I started writing this post with the intention of providing sections on each category of equipment and offering thoughts and opinions on each, why I use what I use, and recommendations for new users. That quickly ballooned, giving birth to this _new_ summary - a quick and dirty overview of some of the things in my equipment cart so that folks can take a look and pick and choose. In later days I intend to post individual articles on different categories (i.e. soldering irons, solder/flux, desoldering equipment, safety equipment) to give them the attention they deserve. Stay Tuned!

## Some Quick Closing Thoughts

The things that made this list are some of the things that I've collected over the years. My needs are my own and may not reflect yours, the only way to really figure out what works for you is to try things until you find what works!

In this list, I prefer to use my Pinecil, with a fume extractor and soldering mat. I wear gloves because I don't like the feeling of my hands when they get electronics residues on them. The syringes with blunt-tip needles help me to apply flux and IPA accurately. I like the tip-tinner because it's easy to apply with one hand. The cotton swabs listed have plastic handles so I don't have to worry about the pressure I apply - the flat end is good for large area cleanup, and the pointed end is good for detailed cleanup work such as removing flux residue from small components and pads. I don't _need_ the microscope for most of the work that I do, but it definitely _does_ make it easier to closely inspect solder joints when I suspect an issue.
